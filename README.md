Add the executables to the path environment variable

``` bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)/bin
``` 

Afterwards, in order to compile and run the programs, **javac-algs4** and **java-algs4**, respectively, have to be used.

Java 7 is used for checking the code in the class. Findbugs will give a bunch of warnings for code compiled with Java 8
